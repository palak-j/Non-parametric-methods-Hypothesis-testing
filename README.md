# Non-parametric-methods-Hypothesis-testing

Correlation, Regression, t-tests, ANOVA etc. are all parametric methods because they involve estimation of a parameter with a statistic and the statistic is assumed to follow a theoretical distribution (e.g., normal distribution).
Non-parametric methods do not require a theoretical distribution. Almost all non parametric tests involves ranking the raw data to analyze the data as Ranks can reduce the effects of extreme values.

When to use non-parametric tests:
1) When our area of study is better represented by the median.
2) When data is not normally distributed. To know if our data is normally distributed or not, we will check skewness and kurtosis of the data. For normally distributed data, value of skewness and kurtosis will be 1.
3) When data has outliers that cannot be removed.
4) When data is not normally distributed and sample size is small
